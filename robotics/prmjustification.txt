Why i chose PRM is beacuase PRM is probabilistically complete, meaning that as the number of samples approaches infinity, the probability of finding a solution (if one exists) approaches one. RRT, on the other hand, 
is only probabilistically complete under certain conditions and may struggle to find solutions in narrow passages or highly constrained environments.Therefore since I wanted the most complete algorithm with all sorts of environments I went with the PRM over the RTT.
Also in addition PRM tends to generate a smoother path compared to RTT which lack the sharp turns normally found in RTT
